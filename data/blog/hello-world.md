## Intro

In this blog article I am going to outline what this blog is all about. Since I always have some interesting projects going on in my life my girlfriend Julia and my good friend Johannes ([Blog](https://typeshare.co/27leaves)) came up with the idea of creating this blog. Thanks a lot for that input! ❤️

On the blog I want to cover the topics from the areas web development and house renovation. This blog should not only help me to document my projects but is also a call for feedback. If you have any ideas on the topics I am writing about you want to share with me or tipps and tricks on how to do things differently just send me a message on Twitter or LinkedIn.

In the following I am going to give you an overview on the areas I am especially interested in. For now I will keep the blog in English but I might switch the house renovation part to German to facilitate the writing due to the different technical terminology in this area.

## Web Development

I have been working as a web developer since 2016 years. Previous to that work I did a Master's degree in "Media- and Human-Centered Computing" at the "TU Wien" (University of Technology in Vienna). In my current work we are building web-based job board platforms for other companies. For this we are using a decoupled approach where we use Drupal in the backend and Next.js in the frontend. I consider myself a full-stack developer who is experienced writing database queries as well as getting down with CSS stylings. In this blog I am planning to write about my side projects, be it about a product management tool for my father's fruits and vegetable business or a new idea about rendering a 3d scene with integrated head tracking.

## House Renovation

In September 2021 we moved into our new house in Vorarlberg. It's a ready-made house constructed in 1972. Since we had decided to move to this house I have started to borrow loads of books about construction, renovation, etc., from the "TU Wien Bibliothek" (Library of the University of Technology). I have grown great interest into healthy and sustainable construction techniques with a special focus on loam. On this blog I will cover my experiments and insights about my projects. Some example projects I already did was the creation of a small rammed earth wall and the rendering of a basement wall using loam.

## Various

I want to keep the freedom to blog about whatever comes to my mind as well. These entries might be about sports, how I organize my week, my language learning or any other topic I find interesting to share.

Thanks for reading my first post! Looking forward to seeing you again on my next blog entries.
