I am David, a Software Engineer from Austria (Vorarlberg) and I love to explore unknown concepts and bring them together to create something new. These range from the area of web development to computer graphics. To cool my mind down I like to do different sports. Starting from climbing and bouldering over swimming and surfing to running and hiking. My background as a former Taekwondo and coding teacher help to mentor other people in my job as a technical lead at jobiqo. My philosophy of improving every day also brings me to trying to improve my surroundings constantly. Therefore I also like to share infos about projects in our ready-made house which I try to enhance using healthy and sustainable construction techniques. I am especially interested in loam.
